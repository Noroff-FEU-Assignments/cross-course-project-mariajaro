    <p id="web-security-answer">[
        I would advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks by using a hosting service that is adapted to their product. I would also recommend using a web host with robust security. I would also advise them to use a URL that should begin with "https" rather than "http." The "s" in "https" stands for secure, which indicates that the site is using a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Certificate. They should also use a domain that has something about them. They should also have strong passwords and change them often. Secure authorization and authentication are hard to break, so I would recommend them using a framework such as OneLogin or Authenticator. They should also think about network security since it is the act of protecting the exchange of packets of data across the network.
